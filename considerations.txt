** Strings and Symbols **

Right now there is no clear line between strings and symbols. This to
keep the "self-hosted" idea of having as much as possible stored in
language-based structures. This enables greatly simplified VM
instructions, as well as extensive reflection. However, this causes
some problems. Symbols as well as constant string literals are
interned, which is taken advantage of in symbol tables. However, any
*constructed* strings will fail in a lookup exactly because of
this. The solution here is that, whenever a user coerces a string into
a symbol, said string is interned. Still, this is a dangerous area to
tread, so we should be extremely careful around strings and symbols.
